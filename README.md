Hello! My name is Liza De Guerengomba. At Grand Canyon University, I'm a student seeking a B.S. in software development. I'm currently looking for jobs and internships in software engineering, UI/UX design, and front-end web development. I have a strong interest in front-end development, graphic design, and the.net framework.
